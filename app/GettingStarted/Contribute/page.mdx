# Design Contribution Guidelines

## Overview

The JobHai Design System is a living collection of design patterns, components, and guidelines that ensure consistency across our products. This guide outlines how designers can propose, create, and refine components within our design system.

## Design Contribution Process

### 1. Identify the Need

Before creating a new design component, consider:
- Is there a recurring UI pattern across products?
- Are teams solving the same problem differently?
- Does this fill a gap in our current component library?
- Will multiple teams benefit from this component?

### 2. Raise a Design Ticket

Create a ticket that includes:
- Component name and purpose
- User problem it solves
- Design principles it addresses
- Visual references of current implementations
- How it differs from existing components

### 3. Create a Design Proposal

Use our Figma template to create a comprehensive design proposal that includes:
- Component visual specifications
- All states and variants
- Responsive behavior
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility considerations
- Use cases with realistic examples
- Design tokens to be used

### 4. Design Review

Your proposal will undergo review by the design system team to ensure:
- Visual harmony with existing components
- Adherence to our design principles and brand identity
- Accessibility compliance
- Usability across contexts
- Optimal use of design tokens
- Technical feasibility

### 5. Component Development

Once approved, components follow our [lifecycle process](/GettingStarted/Lifecycle):

#### Alpha Phase
- Refine design in Figma with all states and variants
- Create initial component specs for developers
- Define design tokens and variables
- Document usage guidelines and constraints
- Collaborate with developers on implementation

#### Beta Phase
- Test the component in multiple design contexts
- Gather feedback from designers using the component
- Refine based on real-world application
- Complete Figma component documentation
- Ensure the component is properly implemented in the component library

#### Stable Release
- Finalize all design variants and states
- Complete design documentation
- Prepare design education materials if needed
- Add to the main Figma component library

## Design Standards

When designing components:
- Use our established design tokens for colors, spacing, and typography
- Follow our grid system and layout principles
- Design for all states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
- Consider dark/light mode variations
- Design with accessibility as a priority (contrast, touch targets, etc.)
- Include responsive variations for all breakpoints
- Document intended behavior and motion patterns

## Design Tools and Resources

- Use our Figma libraries and templates
- Reference our design token documentation
- Follow our naming conventions for Figma components
- Utilize our design system plugin for consistency checks

## Getting Design Help

If you need assistance with your contribution:
- Join our design system Slack channel
- Attend design system office hours
- Schedule a review session with the design systems team
- Review existing component documentation

We welcome design contributions from all teams and look forward to evolving our design system together.
