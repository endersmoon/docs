# Introduction
 
Welcome to the JobHai Design System! This guide will help you get started with using our design system in Figma, from setup to implementation.

## Getting Started with Figma

### Enabling Libraries

1. Open Figma and navigate to the "Assets" panel (located in the left sidebar)
2. Click on the book icon to access the team libraries
3. Enable the JobHai Design System library by toggling it on
4. You should now see all components, styles, and assets available in your file

### Applying Design Tokens

#### Colors
1. Select any element you want to style
2. In the right sidebar, click on the color property (fill, stroke, etc.)
3. Under "Library", select the JobHai color tokens
4. Choose the appropriate token based on your design needs (e.g., primary, secondary, neutral)

#### Typography
1. Select a text element
2. In the right sidebar, click on the text style dropdown
3. Choose from our predefined text styles (heading, body, caption, etc.)
4. All font properties will be automatically applied

#### Spacing
1. For consistent spacing, use our spacing tokens
2. When adding padding or margins, refer to our space scale (4, 8, 16, 24, etc.)
3. Apply these values in Auto Layout settings for consistent spacing

## Working with Components

### Using Design System Components
1. Click on the "Assets" panel in the left sidebar
2. Browse or search for the component you need
3. Drag and drop the component into your design
4. Customize properties using the right sidebar (variant properties)

### Building Local Components
1. Create your design using atomic components from the library
2. Select all elements that form your component
3. Right-click and select "Create Component"
4. Name your component following our naming convention: [Category]/[Name]/[Variant]
5. Use component properties to create variants when needed

## Auto Layout Best Practices
1. Use Auto Layout for all component designs
2. Set appropriate padding, spacing, and alignment
3. Configure resizing behavior (hug/fill) based on component needs
4. Use nested Auto Layout frames for complex components
5. Maintain consistent spacing using our space tokens

## Documentation

### Using Documentation Kit
1. Create a new page for your component documentation
2. Use the Documentation Kit components from our library
3. Include these sections in your documentation:
   - Overview and usage guidelines
   - Properties and variants
   - Do's and don'ts
   - Code examples (if applicable)
   - Accessibility considerations

### Creating Visual Examples
1. Show your component in different states and variants
2. Provide usage examples in context
3. Include any relevant interaction patterns
4. Document responsive behavior if applicable

## Best Practices

1. Always use components from the library when available
2. Follow our color system and avoid custom colors
3. Maintain consistent spacing using our space scale
4. Document any new components you create
5. Ensure your designs are accessible by checking contrast ratios
