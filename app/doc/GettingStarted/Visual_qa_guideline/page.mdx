# Visual QA Guidelines

### Purpose
Ensure pixel-perfect implementation of design system components by verifying visual, functional, and interactive consistency across screens and devices.

### Objective
Quickly identify major visual issues, layout alignment errors, and missing elements.

## Initial Visual Assessment


### Side-by-Side Comparison



#### What to look for
- Layout alignment

- Color mismatches

- Missing elements

- Extra/unwanted components

- Obvious spacing inconsistencies

#### Documentation
- Annotate screenshots

- Create a visual discrepancy list with time stamps

### Layout Structure Check
#### What to do
- Confirm padding, margin, and section placement

- Validate flex/grid layouts

- Review hierarchy of sections

#### Check for

- Screen space utilization

- Proper zoom scaling (1.5× system zoom)

- Correct element stacking and order


## Component-Level QA
#### Typography Verification
##### Checklist
- Is the text style (font family, size, weight) correct?

- Is color accurate?

- Is alignment correct?

- Is spacing (line height, letter spacing) correct?

- Are max/min characters applied?

Tools: WhatFont, browser dev tools, Figma specs

### Layout Precision
##### Checklist
- Are paddings/margins correct?

- Is child element order correct?

- Is screen space optimized?

- Is zoom behavior (1.5×) preserved?

### Responsiveness Check (Web Only)
##### Checklist
- Is the max/min width correct?

- Does content wrap correctly?

- Are tokens changing per breakpoint?

- Are components shifting as per design?

#### Breakpoints to test
-  1280px, 1440px

### Interaction States
#### Checklist

- Are hover/active/focus/disabled states working?

- Is animation smooth?

- Is loader/skeleton shown for heavy loads?

- Is the transition smooth and fluid?

#### Documentation Format

<div className="p-3 bg-muted mt-2 rounded-md">

- Component: Button
- State: Hover
- Expected: #2563EB background
- Actual: #3B82F6
- Status: ❌

</div>

### Component Accuracy
#### Checklist
- Is the correct component used?

- Is the correct variant used?

- Are all states (default, hover, disabled) working?


### Asset Integrity
#### Checklist

- Is aspect ratio maintained?

- Are images pixelated or stretched?

### Content Accuracy
#### Checklist
- Does content match the Figma file?

- Does it adapt to multiple languages?

- Is it breaking layout or alignment?

### Flows & Use Case Coverage
#### Checklist

- Are all intended flows working?

- Are use cases fully covered in navigation/interaction?
