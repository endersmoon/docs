# Sound Design
 
Sound is essential for making great user experiences. Here are the sound we use across JobHai.

### Job Post
This sound is played when a user posts a job.

<audio className='mt-2' src="/Jobpost.mp3" controls></audio>

### Credit Spent
This sound is played when a user spends credits.
<audio className='mt-2' src="/credit.mp3" controls></audio>


### Toast
This sound is played when a user sees a toast.
<audio className='mt-2' src="/toast.mp3" controls></audio>


### Warning
This sound is played when a user sees a warning.
<audio className='mt-2' src="/Warning.mp3" controls></audio>




### Accessibility Guidelines

- Always provide visual feedback alongside audio cues
- Allow users to control or disable sounds
- Keep sounds brief and non-intrusive
- Ensure sounds don't autoplay without user consent
