### Language Principles

- **Simple, conversational Hindi & English**  
  - Use Hinglish where natural (e.g., “Apply karo”).
  
- **Culturally familiar phrases**  
  - Prefer “Naukri chahiye?” over “Looking for a job?”

- **Respectful yet informal tone**  
  - Use “aap” in Hindi; polite and direct language in English.



###  Grammar & Structure
