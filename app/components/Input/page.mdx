# Input Field




A text field is an input field that merchants can type into. It has a range of options and supports several text formats including numbers.


### Text Input

<div className='flex  justify-center items-center h-[200px] w-full border gap-4 border-gray-200 rounded-md mt-3'>
  <Input className='w-2/3 md:w-1/2' placeholder='Enter input' />
</div>

### Number Input

<div className='flex  justify-center items-center h-[200px] w-full border gap-4 border-gray-200 rounded-md mt-3'>
  <Input className='w-2/3 md:w-1/2' type='number' placeholder='Enter input' />
</div>

### When to use this?

Use the text input component when you need to let users enter text that’s no longer than a single line, such as their name or phone number.

### When not to use this?

Do not use the text input component if you need to let users enter longer answers that might span multiple lines.


### How to use this?
All text inputs must have labels, and in most cases the label should be visible.

You should align labels above the text input they refer to. They should be short, direct and written in sentence case. Do not use colons at the end of labels.


#### Avoid Placeholders
Do not use placeholder text in place of a label, or for hints or examples, as:

it vanishes when the user starts typing, which can cause problems for users with memory conditions or when reviewing answers
not all screen readers read it out


#### Hint text
Use hint text for help that’s relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it.

Keep hint text to a single short sentence, without any full stops.

Do not use links in hint text. While screen readers will read out the link text when describing the field, they usually do not tell users the text is a link.
