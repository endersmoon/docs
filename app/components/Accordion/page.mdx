### When to use this?

Only use an accordion if there’s evidence it’s helpful for the user to:

- see an overview of multiple, related sections of content
- choose to show and hide sections that are relevant to them
- look across information that might otherwise be on different pages

For example, an accordion can work well if the user needs to reveal and compare information that’s relevant to them.
Accordions can also work well for people who use a service regularly.

### When not to use this?
Accordions hide content from the user. Not all users will notice them or understand how they work. For this reason, you should only use them in specific situations and if user research supports it.
Do not use an accordion for content that all users need to see.
It’s usually better to:

- simplify and reduce the amount of content
- split the content across multiple pages
- keep the content on a single page, separated by headings
- use a list of links at the start of the page (known as ‘anchor links’) to take the user to particular sections of a page

Accordions work best for simple content and links. Do not use accordions to split up a series of questions. Use separate pages instead.

- Do not put accordions within accordions, as it will make content difficult to find.
- Do not use the accordion component if the amount of content inside will make the page slow to load.

### When to use accordions vs tabs?
The Accordion component, and Tabs component all work by hiding sections of content which a user can choose to reveal. Avoid using any of these components within one another.

If you decide to use one of these components, consider if:

- the user needs to look at more than one section at a time – an accordion can show multiple sections at a time, unlike tabs
- the user needs to switch quickly between sections – tabs can show content without pushing other sections down the page, unlike accordions
- there are many sections of content – accordions can fit more sections as they’re arranged vertically, unlike tabs which are arranged horizontally
