## Usage Guidelines

- Use accordions to organize complex information into digestible sections
- Keep accordion titles clear and concise, ideally 1-3 words
- Ensure the content within each accordion panel is related to its heading
- For critical information, consider using more prominent UI components instead
- Limit nesting of accordions to maintain usability
- Default state should have the most relevant section expanded
- Avoid putting form submission buttons inside accordion panels
